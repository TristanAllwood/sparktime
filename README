SparkTime

A work-in progress inline timestamp visualiser, suitable for use in
tables to allow quick comparison of the relative time events occured in.

See test.html for a sample.

Features:
  * Red markers for fixed times across all instances of a sparktime.
    (e.g. start time, end time)
  * Feint orange marker for right now, if within start/end ranges.
  * Black dots for "events".
  * Background band highlights weekend/weekdays differently.
  * Hover shows approx time the mouse is looking at.

This is currently a quick prototype/proof of concept - it needs a lot of
work/polish before it's generally usable.  Uses jquery 1.9.1 (bundled) and
html5 canvas. Only tested on chromium so far...
